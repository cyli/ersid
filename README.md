# Ersid

Ersid is an educational example of a Twisted-based application.

It is a simple REST HTTP server that simply allows storage and retrieval of
arbitrary blobs.

When you run ./bin/service, the server will be started. It has three features:

- a REST HTTP server that listens on port 8080
- an interactive interpreter (using Twisted's manhole) accessible via SSH
  on port 8022.
- disk-based persistence; all data is saved to a dump file on an interval.


# Usage

After running ./bin/service, you can the following operations:

Set "mykey" to "myvalue":

    $ curl -XPOST -d myvalue http://localhost:8080/mykey

Fetch "mykey":

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/mykey
